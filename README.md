# Smart planner

This is the final project in the course HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web standards at Lernia.

This project is made by me and the technologies I have used are HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap.
Bootstrap and custom CSS to style the page, Javascript for DOM-manipulation and jQuery for some color changes.
