# Smart planner


This is the final project in the course "HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web standards" at Lernia.

Made by: Ann-Sofie Pettersson

The technologies I have used in this project are HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap and Font Awesome.
Bootstrap and custom CSS to style the page, Javascript for DOM-manipulation, Font Awesome for icons and jQuery for some effects and color changes.
